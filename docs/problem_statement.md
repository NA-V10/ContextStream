# Problem: Context Debt

Teams constantly re-create context: repeating decisions, rewriting reasoning, and re-onboarding teammates to prior discussions.

This leads to:
- Lost productivity  
- Meeting overload  
- Decision reversals  
- Frustration and slow velocity  

No existing tool maintains “living context.”  
ContextStream solves this by extracting decisions, rationale, and next steps from any conversation.
