# Solution: ContextStream

ContextStream ingests Slack threads, meetings, and email conversations and instantly extracts:

- Decisions
- Rationale
- Next steps

It runs in two modes:
1. **mock** — fast heuristic extraction  
2. **openai** — high-quality LLM extraction  

The prototype shows how teams can eliminate context debt and onboard instantly.
