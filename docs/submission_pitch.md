# ContextStream — Kill Context Debt

Teams waste hours repeating context and re-explaining decisions. ContextStream extracts decisions, rationale, and next steps from any conversation so teams onboard instantly and move faster.

**Impact:**  
- Saves hours per week  
- Reduces meeting load  
- Eliminates decision reversals  
- Boosts velocity  

The prototype runs in `mock` mode without API keys. `openai` mode uses LLM extraction for high accuracy.

We are seeking pilot teams using Slack/Notion and feedback to refine integrations.
